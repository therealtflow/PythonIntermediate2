I had to install python on my mac to get this to work - 
- so one of the requirements is that you need to have python installed on your computer
I installed python3 so the commands for this were as follows

--
python3 -m venv vm
source vm/bin/activate
pip3 install numpy (i had to use pip3 instead of pip, you may be able to use pip)
--

within the terminal you will also have to run the file - 
- you must know where the file is in your system
the commands I used to run the file are as follows 

--
cd desktop/ITSC3155/pythonint2
chmod +x ex3.py
./ex3.py
-- 

after this the code should run correctly
